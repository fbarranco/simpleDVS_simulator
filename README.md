# Simple simulator for DVS data 

This package implements a simple method for creating event-based camera data (DVS data) from images and groundtruth motion 

## Getting Started

Clone or download the project. This repository contains Matlab M-files and some sequences stored with Git LFS.
After this, you will have a copy of the project for testing.

## Running the tests

Just run
```
simulateEvents(/path/to/file, filename, factor)
```
	* `/path/to/file` is the pathname to the mat file with the inputs (see the examples in the sequences.zip)  
	* `filename` is the mat file with the inputs (see the examples in the sequences.zip): II (vector of images), O_t (2D groundtruth: x speed, y speed)
	* `factor` modulates the number of frames, or the minimum latency (check code)
